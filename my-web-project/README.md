# My Web Project

This project integrates the Stagewise toolbar to provide AI-powered editing capabilities through a browser toolbar. The toolbar allows developers to select elements in the web app, leave comments, and let AI agents make changes based on the context.

## Project Structure

- `src/main.ts`: Entry point of the application where the StagewiseToolbar is initialized and other components are set up.
- `src/components/StagewiseToolbar.tsx`: Defines the StagewiseToolbar component, integrating Stagewise functionality and setting up the plugins through the `config` prop.
- `src/types/index.ts`: Contains type definitions used throughout the application, allowing for better type safety and code clarity.
- `public/index.html`: HTML template providing the basic structure when the application loads.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for npm, listing project dependencies and scripts, including those required for Stagewise.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file specifying compiler options and files to include.
- `extensions.json`: Contains the recommended extensions for VS Code, ensuring the Stagewise extension is included.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using your package manager (npm, yarn, etc.).
3. Run the application in development mode to see the Stagewise toolbar in action.

## Usage

Once the application is running in development mode, the Stagewise toolbar will appear in the bottom right corner of the web app. You can interact with it to leverage AI editing capabilities.
